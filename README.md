# Basic Volume Calculator
A basic volume calculator consisting of 3D ~~and some very basic 4D shapes~~*.

I intend to keep working on this project slowly over time. Adding new features including new shapes and measurements (rather than just numbers).

This is a personal project, however I would like to hear feedback if there is something I have done wrong or could do better.

TODO List:
* Make the screen dynamic (If the user expands the window everything in it should also expand).
* Add more shapes
* Fix warning messages
* Change visuals to be more appealing.

\* The reason for the excusion of 4D shapes at this time is due to the amount of research needed into the math for these objects. If more time becomes available for more research it may get added in the future.
