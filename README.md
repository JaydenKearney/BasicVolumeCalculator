# Basic Volume Calculator
A basic volume calculator consisting of 3D and some very basic 4D shapes.

I intend to keep working on this project slowly over time. Adding new features including new shapes and measurements (rather than just numbers).

This is a personal project, however I would like to hear feedback if there is something I have done wrong or could do better.
